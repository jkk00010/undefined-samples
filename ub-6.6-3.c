/* An arithmetic constant expression does not have arithmetic type; has operands that are not integer constants, floating constants, enumeration constants, character constants, sizeof expressions whose results are integer constants, or _Alignof expressions; or contains casts (outside operands to sizeof or _Alignof operators) other than conversions of arithmetic types to arithmetic types (6.6). */
